# TunaOS Scoop Bucket

Scoop bucket for TunaOS tooling. The release pipelines of the upstream
repositories (for example, GoReleaser) publish the manifests.

<!-- hive-contribute-plea: donated-compute appeal, keep in sync across repos -->
## Contribute compute — no code needed

**[Donate time with your AI CLI](https://hub.tunaos.org/#contribute).**

Your machine runs one task at a time using your signed-in AI coding CLI.
The relay alternates between eligible **School** (OS) and **Reef** (apps)
hives after each task. If one hive has no work, the other can continue.

The guide covers prerequisites, verified `just` setup, credentials, provider
costs, and how to stop with Ctrl+C. Your subscription quota or API charges apply.
Never post account credentials or API keys in issues or pull requests.

## Contributing manifests

Add Scoop manifests as JSON files under `bucket/`. Before you open a pull
request, run the dependency-free validator and its unit tests from the
repository root:

```console
python3 tests/validate_manifests.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

See the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for manifest requirements,
contribution scope, and release-pipeline ownership guidance.
